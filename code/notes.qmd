`results: asis` means that the output of this code chunk will be included directly in the book\
`message: false` means that any messages generated by the code won't be shown in the book\
`cli:::ruler()` means to print a ruler line for visual separation\
`include: false` means that this code chunk won't be shown in the book, including its output\
`eval: false` means that this code chunk won't be run when the book is built\
`echo: false` means that the code in this chunk won't be shown in the book\
`fig-cap: content` means the caption for the figure\
`fig-alt` means the alt text for accessibility\
`out.width: NULL` means the figure will be its natural width\
`out.width: ~` means the figure will be scaled to the specified width

This is a note about including images in Quarto documents.

There are three interrelated rules that make a dataset tidy:

1.  Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
2.  Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
3.  Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

when asking questions, it's better to use `reprex::reprex()`, which creates a minimal, reproducible example that includes all necessary library calls and data loading steps.

Investing a little time in learning R each day will pay off handsomely in the long run.

Once you're inside a project, you should only ever use relative paths not absolute paths.

As a general rule of thumb, it's better to prefer long, descriptive names that are easy to understand rather than concise names that are fast to type.

`ctrl shift p` to open the command palette, then type "styler", to style the current file for tidyverse style.
